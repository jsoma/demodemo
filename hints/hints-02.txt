DRAW YOUR DOTS FIRST. They'll be much easier.





















What kind of scale do you need for a category (country) being matched to another category (color)?





















When using that kind of scale, you don't need to give it a domain at all, you can just give it a range. It'll automatically assign colors to unknown new values when you try to use it.















We have many many data points, but not so many countries/lines. We need to group them together! How do you do that in d3?
















d3.nest! Be sure to give it the right column to group by. Look at the result using console.log.

















Draw the lines, then try to color them.














You do NOT use colorScale(d.LOCATION) for the color, even though that worked for the dots.











When you group your data together to make 'nested', you changed it a little. "d" is no longer a datapoint, it's a dictionary with two things - a key (the name of the group) and all of the values in that group.














Use console.log and think about how to find the country name!














Want there to not be a comma any more in the year on the x axis? Use this.
var xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xPositionScale).tickFormat(d3.format("d"))
